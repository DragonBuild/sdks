/*!	@brief	Configuration parameters for exposure detection.

	Risk Parameters
	
	The four parameters used to calculate the Total Risk Score:
	
	-	Transmission - purely app defined, flexibility to tag a specific positive key. Could be tagged based on symptoms, 
		level of diagnosis verification or other determination from the app/health authority.
	-	Duration (measured by API) - Cumulative duration of the exposure Days (measured by API).
	-	Days since the exposure incident.
	-	Attenuation (measured by API) - Minimum bluetooth signal strength attenuation (Tx Power - RSSI).
	
	Risk Level Value:
	The value, ranging from 0 to 8, that the app assigns to each Risk Level in each of the Risk Level Parameter.  
	
	Risk Level:
	The eight “buckets” assigned to each Risk Level Parameter.
	
	Risk Score:
	The resulting score from the risk calculation (an integer).  The maximum score per person over a 24 hour period.
	
	These parameters are used to calculate a risk for each exposure incident using the following forumula:
	
	TotalRiskScore = 
		( attenuationLevelValue * attenuationWeight ) *
		( daysSinceLastExposureLevelValue * daysSinceLastExposureWeight ) *
		( durationLevelValue * durationWeight ) *
		( transmissionRiskLevelValue * transmissionRiskWeight )
	
	Level values are in the range 0-8.
	Weights must be in the range 0-100.
