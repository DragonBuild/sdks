/*!
 @brief VNGenerateOpticalFlowRequest will determine directional change vectors for each pixel in the targeted image to transform it into the image processed
        by the request handler, reporting this result with a single VNPixelBufferObservation.

 @discussion	Because this request works at the pixel level, both images must have the same dimensions in order for the request to be successfully performed.
				Setting a region of interest will isolate where the change determination is performed; however, the resultant observation will still be reported
				with a full resolution VNPixelBufferObservation.
                Optical flow requests are very resource intensive, so it is recommended that only one request at a time be created and that the handler
                where the request was issued be released immediately after generating optical flows.
