    @brief A request that builds evidence over time. This means that the request has to be reused from frame to frame. The request requires the use of CMSampleBuffers with timestamps as input. Otherwise a VNErrorTimeStampNotFound error will be returned. VNStatefulRequest is used as a base class to other requests no objects of the type of this request should be created directly.

The request will not process buffers that fall within the frameAnalysisSpacing after it has performed the analysis.

@brief The minimum number of frames that the request has to process on before reporting back any observation. This information is provided by the request once initialized with its required paramters.
@discussion Video based request often need a minimum number of frames before they can report back any observation. An example would be that a movement detection requires at least 5 frames to be detected. The minimumLatencyFrameCount for that request would report 5 and only after 5 frames have been processed an observation would be returned in the results. This latency is indicative of how responsive a request is in respect to the incoming data.
